                Zerobase Foundation (“Zerobase”) commits completely to
                protecting your privacy. This privacy policy was created in
                order to demonstrate Zerobase’s unfaltering prioritization of
                your privacy as a user of the Zerobase platform (the “Platform).
                This policy explains what information is collected and how this
                information is used. As our technology evolves and laws change,
                we may update this notice and any supplemental privacy notices
                to reflect changes in our practices and applicable law. If we
                update this policy, we will post a notice of any material
                updates on our site.
              </p>
              <h4>Links to Third Party Sites</h4>
              <p>
                This notice does not apply to any third-party sites that may
                link to, or be accessible from, our sites. Your interactions
                with these sites are governed by the third parties’ applicable
                privacy notices, statements, or policies. We encourage you to
                read them.
              </p>
              <h4>What data we collect from you</h4>
              <h4>Data we collect automatically</h4>
              <p>
                We may collect what is called a device “fingerprint,” which
                tells us about the kind of phone you are using and its browser
                settings. Such data does not uniquely identify the device,
                meaning that many devices will have the same fingerprint.
              </p>
              <h4>Data you provide about yourself</h4>
              <p>
                You may voluntarily provide your email or phone number for the
                sole purpose of receiving notifications. If you contact us via
                email, you may give us your email address and any personal data
                contained in any comments, photos, feedback, or other
                information you submit. We will not use this information for any
                purpose except to respond to inquiries.
              </p>
              <h4>Data concerning health</h4>
              <p>
                We may collect what is considered data concerning health under
                the GDPR when you check in to a certain kind of provider of
                public health services.
              </p>
              <h4>Other special categories of data</h4>
              <p>
                We will not intentionally or unintentionally collect other
                “special categories of data” under the EU General Data
                Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) without your explicit consent for
                one or more specified purposes or as otherwise permitted or
                required by applicable law. Special categories of data include
                personal data (a) revealing racial or ethnic origin, political
                opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union
                membership; or (b) concerning a natural person’s sex life or
                sexual orientation.
              </p>
              <h4>Minors</h4>
              <p>
                Our site is not intended for minors (individuals under the age
                of 13, or equivalent minimum age depending on jurisdiction), and
                we do not knowingly have users that are minors.
              </p>
              <h4>How we use your data</h4>
              <h4>Purposes</h4>
              <p>
                The data is being collected for purposes of disease control,
                epidemic response, and public health research. We may use your
                personal data to: send you information you have expressly chosen
                to receive [with your consent], contribute to our archive of
                information in the public interest [for our legitimate
                interests]; and/or comply with applicable law, court order,
                subpoena, or legal process served on us [to comply with legal
                obligations]. We may use data concerning health because
                processing is necessary for the purposes of: preventive or
                occupational medicine; the provision of health or social care or
                treatment; or the management of health or social care systems
                and services. We may use your IP address to find out your broad
                region, such as country or state, to determine whether we need
                to comply with GDPR or other privacy laws.
              </p>
              <h4>Legal bases under the GDPR</h4>
              <p>
                If you are in the European Union, we will collect and use your
                personal data only if we have one or more legal bases for doing
                so under the GDPR. This means we collect and use your personal
                data only where: you have given your consent for one or more
                specific purposes; it is necessary to perform a contract we are
                about to enter into or have entered into with you; it is
                necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third
                party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override
                those interests; it is necessary to protect the vital interests
                of you or another natural person; or it is necessary to comply
                with a legal obligation. We will indicate in brackets the legal
                basis or bases on which we are relying following each purpose.
                Where we are relying on consent as the legal basis, we will
                notify you and seek additional consent before using your
                personal data for a new purpose that is inconsistent with the
                original purpose for which we collected it. (However, due to the
                purposes of Zerobase, this is unlikely.)
              </p>
              <h4>When we share your data</h4>
              <h4>Relevant authorities in the interest of public health</h4>
              <p>
                If you voluntarily provided your email or phone number, we may
                provide your email or phone number to relevant local, state, or
                federal authorities, such as healthcare providers, in the
                interest of public health, for example contacting you to inform
                you that you may have been exposed to an infectious disease.
              </p>
              <h4>Law enforcement</h4>
              <p>
                We may share your data with law enforcement, other government
                agencies or authorities, or third parties as required by
                applicable law or legal process served on us.
              </p>
              <h4>How we store and protect your data</h4>
              <h4>Storage and transfers </h4>
              <p>
                By default, we only store the anonymous ID that is generated the
                first time you use the Platform. We store your email or phone
                number if you choose to provide one of them for purposes of
                notification. We do not store IP addresses. We never store
                personal health information.
              </p>
              <h4>Storage period</h4>
              <p>
                We will store data until it is no longer needed to fulfill the
                purpose(s) for which it was collected or as otherwise required
                or permitted by law. At such time, this data will be deleted. If
                this is not possible, we will securely store your personal data
                and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible.
                We may dispose of any data at our discretion without notice,
                subject to applicable law.
              </p>
              <h4>Protection</h4>
              <p>
                As the transmission of data via the internet is not completely
                secure, we cannot guarantee the security of your information
                transmitted to our sites and any such transmission is at your
                own risk. However, we maintain appropriate technical and
                organizational measures to prevent unauthorized disclosure of,
                or access to, data.
              </p>
              <h4>Deletion</h4>
              <p>
                If you provided your email or phone number and would like it to
                be deleted, simply contact us and we will no longer store them.
              </p>
