          h1 Privacy Policy
          
          i Last updated: 28 March 2020
          p
          p Zerobase Foundation (“Zerobase”) commits completely to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy was created in order to demonstrate Zerobase’s unfaltering prioritization of your privacy as a user of the Zerobase platform (the “Platform). This policy explains what information is collected and how this information is used. As our technology evolves and laws change, we may update this notice and any supplemental privacy notices to reflect changes in our practices and applicable law. If we update this policy, we will post a notice of any material updates on our site.

          h4 Links to Third Party Sites
          p This notice does not apply to any third-party sites that may link to, or be accessible from, our sites. Your interactions with these sites are governed by the third parties’ applicable privacy notices, statements, or policies. We encourage you to read them. 

          h4 What data we collect from you

          h4 Data we collect automatically
          p We may collect what is called a device “fingerprint,” which tells us about the kind of phone you are using and its browser settings. Such data does not uniquely identify the device, meaning that many devices will have the same fingerprint.

          h4 Data you provide about yourself
          p You may voluntarily provide your email or phone number for the sole purpose of receiving notifications. If you contact us via email, you may give us your email address and any personal data contained in any comments, photos, feedback, or other information you submit. We will not use this information for any purpose except to respond to inquiries.

          h4 Data concerning health
          p We may collect what is considered data concerning health under the GDPR when you check in to a certain kind of provider of public health services. 

          h4 Other special categories of data
          p We will not intentionally or unintentionally collect other “special categories of data” under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) without your explicit consent for one or more specified purposes or as otherwise permitted or required by applicable law. Special categories of data include personal data (a) revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership; or (b) concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation.

          h4 Minors
          p Our site is not intended for minors (individuals under the age of 13, or equivalent minimum age depending on jurisdiction), and we do not knowingly have users that are minors. 

          //- h4 How we use your data

          h4 Purposes
          p The data is being collected for purposes of disease control, epidemic response, and public health research. We may use your personal data to: send you information you have expressly chosen to receive [with your consent], contribute to our archive of information in the public interest [for our legitimate interests]; and/or comply with applicable law, court order, subpoena, or legal process served on us [to comply with legal obligations]. We may use data concerning health because processing is necessary for the purposes of: preventive or occupational medicine; the provision of health or social care or treatment; or the management of health or social care systems and services. We may use your IP address to find out your broad region, such as country or state, to determine whether we need to comply with GDPR or other privacy laws. 

          h4 Legal bases under the GDPR
          p If you are in the European Union, we will collect and use your personal data only if we have one or more legal bases for doing so under the GDPR. This means we collect and use your personal data only where: you have given your consent for one or more specific purposes; it is necessary to perform a contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you; it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests; it is necessary to protect the vital interests of you or another natural person; or it is necessary to comply with a legal obligation. We will indicate in brackets the legal basis or bases on which we are relying following each purpose. Where we are relying on consent as the legal basis, we will notify you and seek additional consent before using your personal data for a new purpose that is inconsistent with the original purpose for which we collected it. (However, due to the purposes of Zerobase, this is unlikely.) 

          h4 When we share your data

          h4 Relevant authorities in the interest of public health
          p If you voluntarily provided your email or phone number, we may provide your email or phone number to relevant local, state, or federal authorities, such as healthcare providers, in the interest of public health, for example contacting you to inform you that you may have been exposed to an infectious disease. 

          h4 Law enforcement
          p We may share your data with law enforcement, other government agencies or authorities, or third parties as required by applicable law or legal process served on us.

          h4 How we store and protect your data

          h4 Storage and transfers 
          p By default, we only store the anonymous ID that is generated the first time you use the Platform. We store your email or phone number if you choose to provide one of them for purposes of notification. We do not store IP addresses. We never store personal health information. 

          h4 Storage period
          p We will store data until it is no longer needed to fulfill the purpose(s) for which it was collected or as otherwise required or permitted by law. At such time, this data will be deleted. If this is not possible, we will securely store your personal data and isolate it from any further use until deletion is possible. We may dispose of any data at our discretion without notice, subject to applicable law. 

          h4 Protection
          p As the transmission of data via the internet is not completely secure, we cannot guarantee the security of your information transmitted to our sites and any such transmission is at your own risk. However, we maintain appropriate technical and organizational measures to prevent unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, data.

          h4 Deletion
          p If you provided your email or phone number and would like it to be deleted, simply contact us and we will no longer store them.
